📌 Project 1: Global YouTube Trending Analysis
🎯 Objective

Analyze YouTube trending videos dataset across multiple countries to uncover:

What categories trend the most?

Which channels dominate trending videos?

Which videos grow the fastest?

How trending patterns differ across countries?

🔑 Key Features (Explained)
1. Load Dataset (Multiple CSVs)

Use files like USvideos.csv, INvideos.csv, GBvideos.csv.

Each file contains trending video data of that country.

Add a new column → country before merging.

👉 Example:

USvideos.csv → add column country = "US"

INvideos.csv → add column country = "IN"

GBvideos.csv → add column country = "GB"

2. Merge Data Into One DataFrame

Use pd.concat([us_data, in_data, gb_data]).

Final dataset = all countries in one table.

Easy to compare trends across countries.

3. Data Cleaning

Remove duplicates (same video_id appearing multiple days).

Handle missing values.

Map category_id (numeric) → actual category name (Music, Gaming, News, etc.) using the provided JSON file.
